    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>I work as an Applied AI Scientist at Stanbic IBTC Holdings, the Nigerian subsidiary of Standard Bank, Africa's largest bank.</li>
      <li> Previously, I was a software engineer at Duplo for two years</li>
      <li>I enjoyed building great financial software at Duplo. Lots of fun memories from my time there</li>
      <li>I am passionate about AI research with strong interests in multi-step & structured reasoning, conversational & collaborative agents, multimodal & multilingual learning, mechanistic interpretability and knowledge editing. </li>
      <li>I am seeking MS/PhD positions beginning in the Fall of 2026</li>
      <li>
        I have been a chess player for about a decade, but I don't
        think I ever really got good at it; just plain-ass average.
      </li>
      <li>
        Nevertheless, I am still very likely to beat you in a game of chess. Apologies and
        no apologies.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>More..</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        I do a lot of recreational reading because I am interested in learning so many things
      </li>
      <li>I keep trying to learn French and Spanish, but I have no one to converse with, so I am still pretty bad at it.</li>
      <li>
        I read a lot. Anything and everything that piques my interest, if I have the time
      </li>
      <li>
        I am always looking for new challenges and interesting stuff to keep me
        occupied.
      </li>
      <li>
        I spend an insane amount of time lurking on Reddit.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>I have a lot of hobbies but not a lot of free time</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        I enjoy teaching and travelling
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have any questions, offers or opportunities that could make my life more interesting, get in touch with me via
        <a href="mailto:contact@luckynkwocha.com">email</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the reason stated above, I will only respond to those proposals
        that are a good match for my schedule and interests.
      </li>

      <li>
        I have both WhatsApp and X. If you know me personally, we probably
        already connected on WhatsApp. If not, here is my
        <a href="https://x.com/lucky_nkwocha">X profile</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        I do have a
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucky-nkwocha"
          >linkedin</a
        >
        but I never share my thoughts there.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have a poorly written <a href="./blog.html">blog</a>, but I have been
        very lazy to put it in order.
      </li>
    </ul>
