    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>I am currently a software engineer at Duplo</li>
      <li>I am passionate about AI & Policy</li>
      <li>My research interests span the duo of natural language and machine vision, particularly generative modeling and multimodal language models</li>
      <li>Recently, my primary research focus has been on  reasoning in Vidion Language Models (VLMs)</li>
      <li>
        I have been a chess player for about a decade but I don't
        think I ever really got good at it; just plain-ass average.
      </li>
      <li>
        Nevertheless, I am still very likely to beat you in a game of chess. Apologies and
        no apologies.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>More..</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>I recently picked up French and Spanish</li>
      <li>
        I read a lot. Anything and everything that piques my interest if I have the time

      <li>
        I am always looking for new challenges and interesting stuff to keep me
        occupied.
      </li>
      <li>
        I spend an insane amount of time lurking on Reddit.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>I have a lot of hobbies but not a lot of free time</h3>

      </li>
      <li>
        I have a poorly written <a href="./blog.html">blog</a> but I have been
        very lazy to put it in order.
