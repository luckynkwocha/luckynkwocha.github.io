    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>I am currently a software engineer at Duplo.</li>
      <li>I am passionate about AI research with strong interests in AI safety, governance, and policy. </li>
      <li> I aim to contribute to the responsible development of AI systems</li>
      <li>My current work is on multi-step & structured reasoning, conversational & collaborative agents, multimodal & multilingual learning, mechanistic interpretability and knowledge editing. </li>
      <li>I am seeking MS/PhD positions beginning in the Fall of 2026</li>
      <li>
        I have been a chess player for about a decade, but I don't
        think I ever really got good at it; just plain-ass average.
      </li>
      <li>
        Nevertheless, I am still very likely to beat you in a game of chess. Apologies and
        no apologies.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <li>
        I am always looking for new challenges and interesting stuff to keep me
        occupied.
      </li>
      <li>
        I spend an insane amount of time lurking on Reddit.

      </li>
      <li>
